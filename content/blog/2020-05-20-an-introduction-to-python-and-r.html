<p>When it comes to data science, there has been a debate between Python and R languages that I have recently learned about. Although I prefer to use R, both Python and R are generally useful and helpful for coding. However, each has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>For instance, Python generally has a more simplified syntax (ex. has less braces and parentheses) and is more popularly used among people. On the other hand, R offers more easily accessible packages and is used more often by those specifically in the field of biostats.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of both Python and R. The first example is one of the most basic expressions in Python. I decided to print out “Austin, we’re going to get through this!” I saw this message written in chalk on the sidewalk of South Congress and wanted to express support towards the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#this is a very basic python code chunk
print(&quot;Austin, we&#39;re going to get through this!&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Austin, we&#39;re going to get through this!</code></pre>
<p>The second example of Python is extracted from part of a homework I was assigned in class. The following presents with several real-world strings. The task is to use regular expressions in python to match (and return) the requested parts in each.
Using re.findall(), match all numbers and pull them from the following string (string1).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import re

string1=&quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&#39;,\&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking&quot;
print(string1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314&#39;,&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>re.findall(r&#39;[0-9]+&#39;, string1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;12&#39;, &#39;47&#39;, &#39;48&#39;, &#39;189&#39;, &#39;2036&#39;, &#39;314&#39;, &#39;125&#39;, &#39;789&#39;, &#39;1450&#39;, &#39;564&#39;, &#39;90456&#39;, &#39;7890&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>This third example of Python is also extracted from part of a homework I was assigned in class. Using re.findall(), match all IP addressses in this string (string2).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>string2=&quot;Jan 13 00:48:59: DROP service 68-&gt;67(udp) from 213.92.153.167 to 69.43.107.219, prefix: \&quot;spoof iana-0/8\&quot; \

re.findall(r&#39;[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+){3}&#39;, string2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;213.92.153.167&#39;, &#39;69.43.107.219&#39;, &#39;69.43.112.233&#39;, &#39;217.70.100.113&#39;, &#39;74.125.186.208&#39;, &#39;74.125.186.208&#39;, &#39;140.105.63.158&#39;, &#39;172.45.240.237&#39;, &#39;217.70.177.60&#39;, &#39;216.34.90.16&#39;, &#39;69.43.85.253&#39;, &#39;213.121.184.130&#39;, &#39;213.121.184.130&#39;, &#39;140.105.63.164&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>As a tip: to help connect Python and R together in chunks, you can install and use reticulate. Below is an example of reticulate with Python and R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate) 
#this is an R code chunk 
y&lt;-10</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>r.y-7==3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## True</code></pre>
