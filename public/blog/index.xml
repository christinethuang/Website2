      <description>When it comes to data science, there has been a debate between Python and R languages that I have recently learned about. Although I prefer to use R, both Python and R are generally useful and helpful for coding. However, each has their own advantages and disadvantages.
For instance, Python generally has a more simplified syntax (ex. has less braces and parentheses) and is more popularly used among people. On the other hand, R offers more easily accessible packages and is used more often by those specifically in the field of biostats.</description>
